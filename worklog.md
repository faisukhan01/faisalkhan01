Task ID: 2
Agent: Cron Review Agent (Round 2)
Task: QA current site, fix bugs, add missing sections (Articles, Contacts), improve styling and add new features.

Work Log:
- Reviewed worklog.md to understand prior progress (Task 1 built the base portfolio)
- Performed QA with agent-browser: took screenshots at multiple scroll positions
- Ran VLM analysis identifying issues: spacing in hero, missing Articles/Contacts sections (nav linked to non-existent #articles and #contacts anchors), work table alignment
- Identified that nav referenced Articles and Contacts but those sections were missing — bug fixed
- Created new ArticlesSection component with 3 article cards in a grid (tag badge, rotating arrow icon, title, excerpt, date + read time, hover lift)
- Created new ContactsSection component with large "Let's build something together" heading, contact info (location, email, response time), social follow buttons, decorative circular outline accents
- Created ScrollProgress component: top scroll progress bar (spring physics) + right-side vertical section dots with active state via scroll spy using useMotionValueEvent
- Upgraded Navigation: scroll-spy active state with layoutId animated pill, scrolled state, mobile hamburger menu with AnimatePresence, language switcher with active underline indicator, logo dot accent
- Upgraded HeroSection: added subtle grid pattern background, magnetic CTA button (tracks cursor with useMotionValue + spring physics), animated scroll indicator at bottom, refined layout
- Upgraded ProjectCards: keyboard arrow navigation, dot indicators with active width, year badge, image zoom on hover, direction-aware slide animation, project counter, improved easing
- Upgraded AboutSection: added stats row (5+ years, 40+ projects, 20+ technologies), download CV link with animated underline, profile image with grayscale-to-color hover, online status dot, sticky on desktop
- Upgraded SkillsSection: refactored to SkillCard component with tech count badge, subtle hover state changes
- Upgraded WorkExperience: 5-column grid (year | company | role | tech | arrow), summary row with companies count + total experience, hover arrow animation, better alignment
- Upgraded SocialButtons: filled background on hover, group hover for icon/text color sync
- Upgraded Footer: back-to-top button with arrow icon, animated underline on links
- Updated globals.css: added noise texture overlay (.noise-overlay), grid pattern, gradient text utility, animated underline utility, line-clamp-2 utility, smooth scroll, refined scrollbar, optimizeLegibility text rendering
- Updated page.tsx to wire all new sections + ScrollProgress + noise overlay + extra decorative circle
- Verified with agent-browser: all 3 article cards visible in a row, projects carousel renders correctly with middle highlighted, contacts section with large heading visible, scroll progress bar at top, section dots on right
- Lint passes cleanly, dev server healthy, no console errors

Stage Summary:
- Added 2 missing sections (Articles, Contacts) — fixed broken nav anchors
- Added 1 new feature component (ScrollProgress) with scroll-spy active state
- All 8 existing components upgraded with richer detail, micro-interactions, and polish
- Magnetic cursor-tracking CTA button in hero
- Keyboard-navigable project carousel with dot indicators
- Mobile responsive nav with hamburger menu
- Premium noise texture overlay for depth
- Stats row + Download CV link in About
- Grayscale-to-color profile image hover
- Back-to-top button in footer
- All sections render correctly per VLM verification
- Lint clean, no runtime errors

Unresolved issues / risks:
- The "About project" intro paragraph above the main card is intentional (matches reference) but VLM noted it as slightly disconnected — acceptable per reference design
- Project side cards have intentional blur + opacity for depth-of-field — VLM flagged as "low contrast" but this is the intended design (matches reference's faded side cards)
- Contacts section "follow" social buttons reuse SocialButtons component which has smaller text — acceptable

Priority recommendations for next phase:
- Add a blog/articles detail view (modal or route) when clicking article cards
- Add a contact form with backend API (resend/postmark integration)
- Add page-load preloader animation
- Add cursor-following spotlight effect
- Add project case study modal with image gallery
- Add theme toggle (dark/light) even though design is dark-first
- Add Open Graph image + metadata for social sharing
